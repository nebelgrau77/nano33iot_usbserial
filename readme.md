### arduino_nano33iot serial over USB

Code from a PyBadge/EdgeBadge example (which works) ported to Arduino Nano 33 IoT. Doesn't seem to work, LEDs blink but then stop, there doesn't seem to be any activity on the serial port
or it gets blocked. 

Uses the latest version of the crate, cloned from the official ATSAMD Rust repo.
